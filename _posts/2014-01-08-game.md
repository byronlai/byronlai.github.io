Hunter vs Monsters is a first-person game I created using Unity3D. I built the game in order to learn game development and 3D modeling. The story of game is about a hunter finding monsters in a forest. There are three kinds of weapons that you can use. They are swords, bow and arrows and bombs. You can download the game [here](/assets/game.zip).
